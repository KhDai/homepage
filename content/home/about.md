# Biography

I am currently a junior student majoring in computer science at [Peking University (PKU)](http://english.pku.edu.cn). I am a member of [Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education)](http://www.klmp.pku.edu.cn) at PKU, supervised by [Liwei Wang](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/). I also work as a research intern in [Machine Learning Group at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/), mentored by [Tao Qin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/).

My main research interest is machine learning, especially deep learning. My recent interests mostly focus on neural machine translation. I am also interested in parallel computing.

I am a contestant of ACM-ICPC and I have won gold medals at Regional and China-Final contests. I am also a member of student cluster competition team at PKU, and participated in [the competition at SC16](http://sc16.supercomputing.org/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/index.html).
